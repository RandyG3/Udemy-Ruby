What is a Hash?
    A hash or has map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
    Hashes are called dictionaries, maps, or associative arrays in other languages
    A hash object connects unique indentifiers (keys) to values.

Rules of the Hash
    Hash keys and has values can be objects of any type
    Hash keys must be unique (no dups)
    Hashes shpuld be treated as unordered. Value are extracted by their key,
        not by their order
