    Intro to Classes
        Blueprints for creating objects
    Why do we need classes?
        Ruby;s built-in objects like Arrays or Hashes cannot represent everything
        What is we need to represent Users or Cars or Invoices
        The goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life things
            as classes
        an object is a custom container for data. It's made from a class
        Objects group functionalities into a single unit
    Object Attributes and Methods
        Instance variables (attributes) are variables that belong to the object.
        Attributes provide information about the object's curremt state.
        Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object.
        Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restrics direct access to an object
    Clases and Objects  
        A class is the blueprint, pattern, template, or outline for an object
        An object is an instance of the class. It's created from the class
        Instantiation is the process of creating and object from a class.
        A class is called an abstract type because it hides the complexity of
            interacting with the data, much like a method abstracts the compplexity
            of a process.
    Example:
        House blueprint - all have the same interior design - same # and type of rooms
        the objects (houses) look the same, but they are different objects.
